* Write a laravel website that sells MP3 songs.  Make it as nice and fully functional as you can, but here are the minimum requirements we are looking for:
- Users should be able to browse the store to and add songs to their shopping cart.
- Users should be able to register for an account upon checkout (bonus points if registration is optional).
- After purchasing a song, users should be able to download the MP3 files they purchased.
- MP3 files should be protected from being downloaded if a user has not purchased them.
- Bonus points for an admin tool.
